# TextSpriteGenerator

### DESCRIPTION
<hr>
This program makes horizontal text sprites out of drawings. When you open up the program, a menu will appear. 3 options are available, Create, Help and Quit. The Create option will send you to a blank square where you can draw using the arrow keys, 2nd, ALPHA and CLEAR. Use the arrow keys to move the cursor around. The 2nd key will turn the current pixel on, and the ALPHA key will turn it off. The CLEAR key will erase the whole drawing. Once you have completed your masterpiece, press Enter and the cursor will dissappear. The program will then create code for you to use in your own programs. This may take a while (15-20 seconds on average) since it must check each pixel. Once the program is done, it will display a message to indicate it is finished. In the help option, you will find a reminder of the keys and their functions. 

### USING THE SPRITES
<hr>
To use the text sprites created by this program, simply recall u in your own program. "u" is a sequential variable which can be accessed by typing 2nd 7. You can change the x and y coordinates of the sprite by adding a number to the text() command (simply put a + sign and a number at the correct arguments in the text() command). 

### IMPORTANT NOTES
<hr>
The program checks for blank pixels from right to left and from bottom to top, so to get the most speed out of your text sprite, start drawing from the top left of the square if you don't intend to use the whole square. 
QUOT2ANS.8xp is an assembly program which stores a quote token (0x2A) to Ans. This subprogram is required.

### INSTALLATION
<hr>

Send TXTSPRTS.8xp and QUOT2ANS.8xp to your TI-8X series calculator using your favorite link software (TiLP, Ti-Connect, etc.)
